    A Peacock, puffed up with vanity, met a Crane one day, and to impress him spread his gorgeous tail in the Sun. <br><br>

    <em>"Look,"</em> he said. <em>"What have you to compare with this? I am dressed in all the glory of the rainbow, while your
    feathers are gray as dust!"</em><br><br>

    The Crane spread his broad wings and flew up toward the sun. <br><br>

    <em>"Follow me if you can,"</em> he said. But the Peacock stood where he was among the birds of the barnyard, while the
    Crane soared in freedom far up into the blue sky. <br><br>
