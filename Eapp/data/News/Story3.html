    <p> The Weasels and the Mice were always up in arms against each other. In every battle the Weasels
    carried off the victory, as well as a large number of the Mice, which they ate for dinner next day.
    In despair the Mice called a council, and there it was decided that the Mouse army was always beaten
    because it had no leaders. So a large number of generals and commanders were appointed from among
    the most eminent Mice. <br><br>

    To distinguish themselves from the soldiers in the ranks, the new leaders proudly bound on their heads
    lofty crests and ornaments of feathers or straw. Then after long preparation of the Mouse army in all
    the arts of war, they sent a challenge to the Weasels. <br><br>

    The Weasels accepted the challenge with eagerness, for they were always ready for a fight when a meal
    was in sight. They immediately attacked the Mouse army in large numbers. Soon the Mouse line gave way
    before the attack and the whole army fled for cover. The privates easily slipped into their holes, but
    the Mouse leaders could not squeeze through the narrow openings because of their head-dresses. Not one
    escaped the teeth of the hungry Weasels. <br><br>
