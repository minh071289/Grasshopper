    <p>    One bright day in late autumn, a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine,
        drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer, when a starving Grasshopper,
        his fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat.<br><br>
        <em>“What!”</em> cried the Ants in surprise, <em>“haven’t you stored anything away for the winter?</em>
        <em>What in the world were you doing all last summer?”</em><br><br>
        <em>“I didn’t have time to store up any food,”</em> whined the Grasshopper; <em>“I was so busy</em>
        <em>making music that before I knew it the summer was gone.”</em><br><br>
        The Ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust.<br><br>
        <em>“Making music, were you?”</em> they cried.<br><br>
        <em>“Very well; now dance!”</em><br><br>
        And they turned their backs on the Grasshopper and went on with their work.<br><br>
    <blockquote>There's a time for work and a time for play.</blockquote>
